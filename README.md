# That-Time-I-Did-A-Website
WELL, I had two months outside school and I decided to study a bit html and css. It aint responsive, Im still learning. It served its purpose so I changed all the text and photos for something random so I could post it here


What u need to know!
Unfortunately, it's not fully responsive. I don't know how to fully CSS yet. Just the very basics for it. I did it as a DIY gif for the person im dating, so i (did a backup first, ofc) but had to delete some of the content i had in there and that caused for somethings (such as width/height of certain photo/text containers to change size) and it kinda messed it up. Anyway, I liked the finished project more than this one but I think this is good enough for me to post here. I have to start somewhere amirite?
